1. DEVICES

  1.1 PE     - Pressure elements
    APR-250 for HI pressure
    PKR-251 for MID and LO pressure
    Three thresholds:
      HI  - atmospheric pressure (760 Torr)
      MID - ~1 Torr
      LO  - ~1E-6 Torr
  
  1.2 BP     - Turbo backing pump
    ACP-28 roots type pump.
    On whenever any of the turbo pumps are on.
    
  1.3 BPV    - Turbo backing valve
    VAT HV angle valve.
    BPV_OPEN_CMD = (BP==ON and TP==ON).
    
  1.4 TP     - Turbo pump
    Pfeiffer HiPace80 and HiPace800M.
    PUMPING_STATION_ON = ON_INTERLOCK and ((AUTO_MODE and PUMP_REQ) or (MANUAL_MODE and TP_ON_REQ))
    where,
    ON_INTERLOCK = (BP==ON and BPV==OPEN)
  
  1.5 TPV    - Turbo pump isolation valve
    VAT Gate valve.
    TPV_OPEN_CMD = TPV_OPEN_INTLK and (see pump/vent discussion below)
    TPV_OPEN_INTLK = TP_READY and PE_PSL_MID  (pressure < MID)
  
  1.6 RP     - Rough pump
    Varian Scroll pump
    RP_ON_CMD = (AUTO_MODE and PUMP_REQ and not PUMPED) or (MANUAL_MODE and RP_ON_REQ)
    RP_OFF_ENABLE = RPV_CLOSED
    
  1.7 RPV    - Rough pump isolation valve (SLOW and FAST)
    VAT HV softstart and normal angle valves.
    RPV_OPEN_INTLK = RP_ON and ESV_CLOSED and MASKV_CLOSED
    RPV_OPEN = (AUTO_MODE and see pump/vent discussion below) or (MANUAL_MODE and RPV_OPEN_REQ)
  
  1.8 VENT   - Vent valve (SLOW and FAST)
    Swagelok dual leg assembly.
    VENT_OPEN_INTLK = ESV_CLOSED and MASKV_CLOSED and TPV_CLOSED and RPV_CLOSED
  
  1.9 ESV    - End station isolation valve
    Closed at start of either pump or vent cycle.
    Also closed during mask loading when MASKV==OPEN.
    
  1.10 MASKV - Isolation valve between load lock and chamber
    Closed at start of either pump or vent cycle.
